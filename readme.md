# Readme

We recommend making changes in the extension views (sf__...) rather than in
the corresponding base views (sfbase__...), so you can regenerate the base
view as needed


In a few places, "query_timezones" have been commented out. You may want to 
update them in case you want the dashboards to use a default different from 
what has been configured by the administrator or users.
